# STRAINS

This repository contains the code associated with the paper 'STRAINS: A Big Data Method for Classifying Cellular Response to Stimuli at the Tissue Scale', authored by Jingyang Zheng, Thomas Wyse Jackson, Lisa A. Fortier, Lawrence J. Bonassar, Michelle L. Delco, and Itai Cohen. The preprint for this paper can be found on bioarxiv at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.12.495830v1

The contents of this repository include: tracking and intensity analysis MATLAB codes, a MATLAB graphical user interface for analyzing videos, and time series classification codes written in Python to make use of the sktime library (found here: https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/).

Due to github's file size constraints, example data for running these codes, along with an example video of the GUI in action can be found at the Cornell eCommons repository here:

Individual instructions for running each section of this code can be found within the folders.
